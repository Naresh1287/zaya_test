Case 1. Ans:-

As all systems having with linux and all in differnet network.

My Assumptions:-

1. If all devices having public ip then no issue if not then we have to create tunnel between them creating tunnel will be little bit tough if 100-1000 server all are in diffrent network but we have to do.

2. Now we have to the sync ssh public key of the server from where you want to monitor to all the remote servers.
    
   or 
   
   we can use snmp if we dont want to use ssh authentication.

3. Now we have to setup a nagios(Icinga) server which will monitor N no of linux server through check by ssh method i.e active check(Because we have already synced the key to all remote server).

we have to add check for the requirement or we can difine in single in single check.

now we will be gettig logs in nagios(icinga) for the above checks that logs we can send to graphite or ELK for the cool visual dashboard.


I am refer this option because all the servers are in different network so i have to go throght internet so i will not use network data transfer method which can directly send the data to graphite or elk because that will in insecure.


Case 2. Ans:-

please refer demotest.txt and sorting_id_mac.py file

demotest.txt is a sample data set file,in which i have assumed device id, ethernet mac and wifi mac, in this file we got data from all remote devices and we collected in single file

sorting_id_mac.py is script, which open the data set file and give the standard output.
